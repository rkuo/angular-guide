<!-- 
step-0-init setup
  - start a basic HTML Hello World template, title and paragraph. No angularjs yet.
  - refer http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts for note
step-1-startup
	- add ng-app to html tag to set boundary of angularjs
	- add reference to angularjs script library in head tag
	- add ng-init in paragraph to initialize some expressions, in here, we set name variable with value 'World'
step-2-runtime 
	- use the value from input tag as ng-model, the value is called "name"
	- part of the p-tag value "name" is linked to the ng-model. It observes/syncs the model. 
step-3-scope: Because the different scope, same variable name may have different values.
	- we added a js file called script.js, which defines two controllers.
	- we have ng-controller="GreetCtrl" in one <div>, and ng-controller="ListCtrl" in the other <div>, they are different scopes. The variable "name" refers to diiferent values.
	- To make display/view more specific for different scopes, we use red color border for different scopes.
